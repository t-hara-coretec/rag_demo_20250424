    <h1>RAG Test Information</h1>
    <p>This is a sample webpage designed to test the RAG functionality in the chat application.</p>
    
    <h2>About Retrieval-Augmented Generation</h2>
    <p>RAG systems combine the power of large language models with specific knowledge retrieval. 
    This allows for more accurate and specific responses based on your actual data.</p>
    
    <h3>Benefits of RAG</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>More accurate responses based on your data</li>
        <li>Reduced hallucinations</li>
        <li>Ability to reference specific information</li>
        <li>Up-to-date knowledge beyond the model's training cutoff</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
    <p>A typical RAG system includes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Document processing: Converting documents into chunks</li>
        <li>Embedding generation: Creating vector representations of text</li>
        <li>Vector database: Storing and searching these representations</li>
        <li>Retrieval mechanism: Finding relevant information based on queries</li>
        <li>Context augmentation: Adding retrieved information to prompts</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>This test page serves as an example of what content might be extracted from a webpage
    and incorporated into the RAG knowledge base.</p>
